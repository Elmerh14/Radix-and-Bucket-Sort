# Merging k sorted list

```

    // will hold our merged list
    mergedList = []
    //we will create a min heap to have access to the smallest element
    buildMinHeap():

        for each list i in lists:
            If list i is not empty:
                //we will insert a tuple (value, list index, element index)
                heap.insert(lists[i][0],i,0) 
        
        while the heap is not empty:
            //pop the tuple with the smallest value 
            value, list_index, element_index = heap.pop()

            //if there is a next element in the list of the tuple we just poped add it to the heap
            if element_index + 1 < len(list[list_index]):
                next_ value = list[list_index][element_index + 1]
                heap.insert(next_value, list_index, element_index + 1)

> This algorithm works by utilizing a min-heap so that we always have access to the smallest element. We will assume we have k sorted list. Since the list is sorted we know that the first elment in each list is the smallest of that of that particular list. From here we can utalize a minheap and push the first element of each list into that heap. Due to the minheap property we will always have access to the smallest element. We will be pushing tuples with the value of that element, the index value, and also the list value (ex. is it the 0th list or the 1st list.). We will then pop the smallest element from the heap and append this to an empty list where we store our results. We will then check weather there is a next value from the list of the number we just poped. If the answer is yes, we will add the next value in that list to the minheap.

> This algorithm works in O(nlogk) time because the proccess of going though every list and checking if there is a next value and adding to the heap is done k times. Then the proccess poping an element from the heap and adding it to the merged list and then checking if there is a next element and adding it to the heap is done once for every element, it is done n times. Since we are performing insertions and removales from a heap we know that those process take O(lgn) time in our case O(lgk) time. So we are left with a time complexity of O(n log k).
